## Proposed Hierarchical Bayesian Model

The following hierarchical Bayesian model was proposed to predict the wind speed of the $i^{th}$ hurricane at time $t+6$:

$$
 Y_{i}(t+6)=\beta_{0, i}+\beta_{1, i} Y_{i}(t)+\beta_{2, i} \Delta_{i, 1}(t)+\beta_{3, i} \Delta_{i, 2}(t)+\beta_{4, i} \Delta_{i, 3}(t)+\varepsilon_{i}(t),   
$$

where $Y_{i}(t)$ is the wind speed at time \textit{t}, $\Delta_{i, 1}(t)$,  $\Delta_{i, 2}(t)$, $\Delta_{i, 3}(t)$ are the changes in latitude, longitude, and wind speed between times $t$ and $t-6$, $\varepsilon_{i}(t)$ is the random error associated with each $Y_{i}(t+6)$

We want to estimate the random coefficients, $\beta_i = (\beta_{1, i}, \beta_{2, i}, \beta_{3, i}. \beta_{4, i})$, for each hurricane. 

## Assumed Prior Distributions

The prior distributions for each of these parameters are assumed to be as follows: 

\begin{align*}
     &\epsilon_{i}(t) \sim N(0, \sigma^{2}) , \text{ which are independent across $t$}\\
     &P\left(\sigma^{2}\right) \propto \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\\
     &P(\boldsymbol{\mu}) \propto 1\\
     &P\left(\Sigma^{-1}\right) \propto|\Sigma|^{-(d+1)} \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \Sigma^{-1}\right),\text{ where $d$ is the dimension of $\beta_i$}\\
     &\beta_{i} \sim N(\mu, \Sigma)\\
\end{align*}

## Goals

1. Construct an MCMC algorithm from which we can sample from a posterior distribution to estimate $\Theta = (\bf{B}, \bf{\mu}, \sigma^2, \Sigma)$.

2. Conduct analysis using estimated parameters to understand their properties.

    a. Seasonal changes in any of the coefficients

    b. Predictive influence of these coefficients on forecasting hurricane impact.

## Discussion

### Strength & Limitation of MCMC methods

\vskip 10pt

- Bypass coefficient optimization process and directly sample coefficients from their assumed distributions

\vskip 10pt

- Often computationally expensive and can be inefficient

\vskip 10pt

- Convergence is not guaranteed

## Why Non-convergence?

- $\boldsymbol \beta_i \sim N(\boldsymbol \beta, \Sigma)$ may be a too strong of an assumption

![Distribution of $\boldsymbol \beta_i$s obtained by performing OLS for each hurricane (red line: $\boldsymbol \beta$ obtained by performing OLS on the whole training dataset)]("plots/discussion.png")

- **Future work**: use a more adequate distribution assumption of $\boldsymbol \beta_i$ which can account for skewness
