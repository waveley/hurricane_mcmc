## train / test

Here we use stratified sampling to sample 80% of data for each hurricane as train data, and use the rest 20% as test data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(2022)
train_index = rownames_to_column(dt) %>% 
  group_by(i) %>% 
  sample_frac(0.8) %>% 
  pull(rowname) %>% 
  as.numeric()

train = dt[train_index,]
test = dt[-train_index,]

test
```
