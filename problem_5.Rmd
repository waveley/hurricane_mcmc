Only beta1 have the significance predictor `year` based on 0.05 significance level. The coefficient of year in this model `r summary(lm_b1)$coefficients[11,1]` and the corresponding P-value is `r summary(lm_b1)$coefficients[11,4]` which is very small. It shows that when year increase the hurricanes wind speeds decrease.

```{r}
b0_sea = summary(lm_b0_season)$coefficients[,c(1,4)]# spring
b1_sea = summary(lm_b1_season)$coefficients[,c(1,4)]# spring, summer, year***
b2_sea = summary(lm_b2_season)$coefficients[,c(1,4)]
b3_sea = summary(lm_b3_season)$coefficients[,c(1,4)]# TS
b4_sea = summary(lm_b4_season)$coefficients[,c(1,4)]# spring**, summer

knitr::kable(cbind(b0_sea, b1_sea, b2_sea, b3_sea, b4_sea)) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Beta 0" = 2, "Beta 1" = 2, "Beta 2" = 2, "Beta 3" = 2, "Beta 4" = 2))
```

Since the first type of linear model can only obtain one significant variable, we want to try the season model to figure out more information between hurricane wind speed and the happened season of the year. The coefficients table above show the result of the second model. For beta 0, 1 and 4, we have spring as the significant predictor. Spring has a positive correlation with beta0, which indicates a higher baseline wind speed in spring than that in fall. Also, spring have a lower present wind speed and a lower change in 6 hours than that in fall since spring has a negative correlation with beta1 and beta4. The type TS hurricanes have p-value around 0.05 for both beta3 and beta4, which can be observed a lower change in 6 hour and a negative correlation with longitude than DS hurricanes. Year has a very small P-value in beta1's model with a negative coefficient, which is the same in the first model.
